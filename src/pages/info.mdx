# Helpful Info

## Schedule

If you're looking for the schedule, you can <Link to="/schedule">find it right here</Link>.

## Venue Information

The conference is at the Jackson Convention Complex (<strong>105 E Pascagoula St, Jackson, MS 39201</strong>).

There is ample (and free) parking directly across from the venue at the corner of Pascagoula St and Farish St.

Enter on the <strong>west side of the building</strong> (right side if you are facing building from parking lots) through the sliding glass doors. <strong>We will be on the 3rd floor</strong>. There should be signs to direct you once you enter the building.

## After Party Information

Unfortunately, I had to cancel the After Party I originally had planned because of budget (turns out, raising ~\$25k in 6 weeks is pretty hard!). However, the party will still [sorta] go on! We will dismiss around 6pm, we will have an open invitation to meet up around 8:30pm at a local bar called [Fondren Public](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fondren+Public/@32.3335561,-90.1775031,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x862832e9d6869733:0xc8ea3c87956e4dda!8m2!3d32.3335516!4d-90.1753144).

Fondren is a pretty neat district of Jackson with a ton of great restaurants. I recommend grabbing some dinner in the area â€” most places are walking distance from the bar!

If budget permits, everyone will get a couple of free beer tokens and we'll hang and have a good time!

## Travel Information

Our airport code is <strong>JAN</strong>. The airport address is:

<address>100 International Dr, Jackson, MS 39208</address>

Our airport is not a very busy airport at all, and it's very tiny, so you shouldn't have any issues getting around or summoning an Uber/Lyft.

The hotel is the Hilton Garden Inn:

<address>235 W Capitol St, Jackson, MS 39201</address>

It's about 3 blocks away from the convention center. We have a block of rooms available at a discounted rate, which can take advantage of by [booking through this link](https://book.passkey.com/e/49883898) (first come, first served!).
