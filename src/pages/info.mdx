# Helpful Info

<strong>Due to the COVID-19 situation, this year's conference is 100% remote.</strong><br /><br />
All talks will be live streamed, and we will also have unique ways to still make it "feel" like a conference, such as breakout rooms, "virtual lunch tables," Q&A rooms with speakers, a "virtual hallway," and more.
