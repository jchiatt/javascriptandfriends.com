      title: "The WebAssembly Revolution Has Begun",
      description: "WebAssembly (aka wasm) is a new, standardized compilation target for the web, shipping in all modern browsers. But since it's so low level it can be difficult to see how it will revolutionize the next generation of web apps–and definitely not just games and C++. This is a game changer for all web developers. In this talk Jay will reveal what it is, how you can use it today, and the incredible opportunities it will unlock in the years to come."
