In this talk Jay will reveal what it is, how you can use it today, and the incredible opportunities it will unlock in the years to come."

      title: "Full Stack Development in the Era of Serverless Computing",
      description: `When people speak about serverless, they typically tend to think about a collection of functions calling each other when in reality the best serverless applications consist of thick client code handling all interaction logic, heavy use of managed services & small glue functions to fill in the missing pieces. In this talk, I'll introduce a workflow that allows developers to build full stack applications using JavaScript & web technologies by taking advantage of managed services & databases, implementing real-world features like authentication, GraphQL APIs, serverless Lambda functions, & chatbots using a CLI based workflow.`
