Svelte is an exciting, newer JavaScript framework that was designed from the ground up with compilation and speed.

When I started to hear folks chirp about these ‚Äúcontainers‚Äù of ‚ÄúLinux‚Äù I just went on my merry way, diving head first into yet-another-JavaScript-framework. However this idea stuck with me: the idea that I could use little self-contained environments to accomplish tasks and then throw them away. I begin to question, ponder, and obsess after this proverbial whale, a Moby Dick of the command line. You too may wonder if I call myself Ishamel, but in the end I too got my whale. üê≥

      Turns out containers are useful for everyone, from the designing of shimmering interfaces to the dredges of the data center, and I think you‚Äôll benefit too from know how it all works. As with all things though, I‚Äôm deadly curious as to what‚Äôs in the belly of the whale (oh no I‚Äôm mixing whale metaphors now), what Docker actually does for me. I believe that the more you understand your tools, the more embrace what they do for you. We‚Äôll craft a container from hand to learn what Docker does for you and then see what we can take from that to make Docker even more useful to us.
